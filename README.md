ShimmerView is a subclass of `UIView` to construct Skelton View + Shimmering Effect type loading indicator. This framework is inspired by Facebook's [Shimmer](https://github.com/facebook/Shimmer).

## Installation

### Carthage

```
github "mercari/ShimmerView"
```

## Usage
Shimmer Effect has four related APIs as blow:
- `ShimmerView`
- `ShimmerSyncTarget`
- `ShimmerReplicatorView`
- `ShimmerReplicatorViewCell`

### `ShimmerView`
`ShimmerView` is a subclass of `UIView` that has `CAGradientLayer` as a sublayer and encapsulates the logic for the shimmering effect animation.
```swift
let shimmerView = ShimmerView()
view.addSubview(shimmerView)
shimmerView.startAnimating()
```

The style of `ShimmerView` can be customized with `ShimmerViewStyle`.
```swift
let style = ShimmerViewStyle(
    baseColor: UIColor(red: 239/255, green: 239/255, blue: 239/255, alpha: 1.0),
    highlightColor: UIColor(red: 247/255, green: 247/255, blue: 247/255, alpha: 1.0),
    duration: 1.2,
    interval: 0.4,
    effectSpan: .points(120),
    effectAngle: 0 * CGFloat.pi)
shimmerView.apply(style: style)
```

### `ShimmerSyncTarget`
`ShimmerView` can be used as it is, but the shimmering effect would be effectively displayed when all the subviewsâ€™s effect in the screen is synced and animated together.

To make the best effect, create a view or view controller that contains multiple ShimmerViews and specify the container as `ShimmerSyncTarget`. ShimmerView will calculate its relative origin against the target and adjust the effect automatically.

### `ShimmerReplicatorView` & `ShimmerReplicatorViewCell`
`ShimmerReplicatorView` will let you create a list type loading screen with a few lines of code.

```swift
let replicatorView = ShimmerReplicatorView(
    itemSize: .fixedSize(CGSize(width: 80, height: 80)),
    interitemSpacing: 16,
    lineSpacing: 0,
    horizontalEdgeMode: .within,
    cellProvider: { () -> ShimmerReplicatorViewCell in
        let cell = ShimmerView()
        cell.layer.cornerRadius = 8.0
        cell.layer.masksToBounds = true
        return cell
})
replicatorView.startAnimating()
```
